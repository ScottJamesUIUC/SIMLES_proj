# SIMLES_proj using a model to predict maize yields for each county and year using predictor variables.

Predictor variables:

GDD = growing degree days (10-29 degC)

EDD = extreme degree days (>29 degC)

SM_mean = average soil moisture

SM_mean2 = average soil moisture squared

prcp = total precipitation (mm)

prcp2 = total precipitation squared (mm)

SM_week_min = weekly soil moisture minimum

SM_week_max = weekly soil moisture maximum


Other variables:
=====

maize_irr_frac = fraction of maize that is irrigated in each county (constant for all years)

fips = county fips code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_FIPS_codes_by_county)

yield = maize yield in bushes per acre

area = harvested area in acres

state = state fips code

year = year
